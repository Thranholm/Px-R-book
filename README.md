# PX-web and R

Contains files for a book about PX-web and R. 
It contains different guides on how to use R to set up a workflow
for creating PX-files (the input for a PXweb statbank). It also contain
more general files about reading data to R and different topics,
but all with the aim to later create PX-files.

The book was initially made for a mission from Statistics Denmark to The National
Institute of Statistics of Rwanda. The book is open for contributions.
